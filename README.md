## Face Recognition App 🤦‍♀️
  
> Back-end to an app that uses user submitted url photos and detects faces. After registering, the user will receive a point towards every submitted image, updated and saved within their profile.

## Development Focus
- Build using Node and Express.
- Utilize [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) for query building.
- Use relational database PostgreSQL to manage user data.
- Migrate [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) connection to the back-end for security.
- Secure user passwords with [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).
- Deploy to Heroku.

## Development Improvement
- [x] Clean-up with controllers.
